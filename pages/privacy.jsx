            <strong>Quidd Intellectual Property</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We own and will continue to own all right, title, and interest in and to (i) the App,
            including, without limitation, all source code, object code, operating instructions, and
            interfaces developed for or relating to the App; (ii) all modifications, enhancements,
            revisions, changes, copies, partial copies, translations, compilations, improvements,

            (iii) any other content and materials available through the App and all intellectual
            property rights therein (collectively, the “<strong>Quidd Content</strong>“). Except as
            expressly permitted in these Terms of Use, you have no rights in or to any Quidd
            Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>User Generated Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You may post and/or create content through the App (hereinafter, “User Generated
            Content”). We cannot and do not review it all–we merely act as a passive conduit for
            distribution of the User Generated Content to other users of the App. That said, we may
            remove User Generated Content that does not adhere to our Community Guidelines, or that
            is offensive or otherwise unacceptable to us in our sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As between us and you, you retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights
            in and to the User Generated Content. You warrant and represent that you either own, or
            have a sufficient license to, all User Generated Content provided through your account.
            You hereby grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
            sublicensable, transferable license to use your User Generated Content as reasonably
            necessary for us to provide you and other users with the App.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, once you submit User Generated Content through the App, it may be accessible
            by other users, including any Personal Information included therein. Please carefully
            consider any User Generated Content that you submit through the App.

            <strong>Virtual Currency</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a legal adult in your country of residence, or if you have been authorized by
            a legal guardian to do so, you may “purchase” or “earn” Virtual Coins from the App
            Stores or third party providers (“<strong>Third Party Providers</strong>“) using real
            world money. All Virtual Coins purchased in this manner will be subject to the payment
            terms and conditions of the applicable App Store or Third Party Provider from whom you
            purchase or earn such Virtual Coins. We do not control how you can pay to such third
            parties. Please review such third parties terms of service for additional information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may use Virtual Coins to purchase digital goods through the App (“
            <strong>Virtual Goods</strong>“).
          </p>
          <p>
            We put the term “purchase” and “earn” in quotes, because you do not own the Virtual
            Coins or the Virtual Goods that are exchanged using the App. All right, title, and
            interest in and to the Virtual Coins and Virtual Goods, including all copyrights,
            trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein, are held by Quidd. When you
            “purchase” or “earn” an item, you have only been granted a limited license to use the
            Virtual Coins and/or the Virtual Good in the App’s virtual world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Restrictions</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Virtual Coins and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed or exchanged for real money,
            goods, services, or any other item of monetary value. Unless expressly authorized in
            these Terms of Use, any transfer or exchange of Virtual Coins, or Virtual Goods is
            strictly prohibited, and any attempt to do so, even outside the scope of the App, is a
            material breach of these Terms of Use and may result in immediate termination of this
            Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quidd has the right to regulate, modify, and/or eliminate Virtual Coins, and/or Virtual
            Goods in its sole and absolute discretion at any time and without notice to you. Quidd
            shall have no liability in connection with the exercise of this right.
          </p>
          <p>
            YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL SALES AND PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL COINS AND/OR
            VIRTUAL GOODS ARE FINAL, AND THAT NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES SHALL BE PERMITTED, EXCEPT IN
            OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.
