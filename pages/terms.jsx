            Your User Generated Content and your Username is viewable by other users of the App,
            including your social media contacts who are also users of the App. We are not
            responsible for any user’s use of such information and their use of the information is
            not subject to this Privacy Policy. Please take care with the information, particularly
            any Personal Information, which you include in your User Generated Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain
            business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases,
            hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a
            function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform
            their specific function, which may include Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the
            information that we have collected, including Personal Information, would be transferred
            along with our other business assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may disclose your information, including Personal Information, to government

            authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not
            limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose such
            information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to
            or interference with our rights or property, other users of the App, or anyone else that
            could be harmed by such activities.

          <h3>
            <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, and
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however,
            that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our
            databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted
            while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to
            or from us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding
            what information you send to us via e-mail.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>Control of Your Information</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            You may update the information that is stored in your user account via the profile and
            settings pages on the App.
          </p>
          <p>
            Individuals who are residents of the European Union and some other jurisdictions outside
            the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold
            personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some
            cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in
            appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal
            data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such
            actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our
            ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.
          </p>
          <p>Some questions you may have, if these rights apply to you may include:</p>
          <p>
            <em>How can I access the personal data you have about me?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like to submit a data access request, you can do some from the “Settings”
            page of the App, where there is a button to request your data by sending an e-mail to
            us. We will then start to the process and provide you a link to access the personal data
            that we have on you within 30 days. We do have the right to ask that you confirm your
            identity, which may be done on a case by case basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>How can I correct, update, amend or delete personal data you have about me?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the functionality available through the “Settings” of the App, in which
            you can correct, updated, amend or delete certain personal data, you can also request
            other modifications from us directly. Please write to us at{" "}

          <p>
            You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in
            certain circumstances –for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data,
            or if you think your personal data is inaccurate.

            The rights and options described above are subject to limitations and exceptions under
            applicable law. You may choose to unsubscribe from our emails by following the
            instructions in the bottom of the email. In addition to those rights, you have the right
            to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you
            to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.

            The App is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United
            States, please be aware that any Personal Information and other information that you

            <strong>Children</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If
            you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents
            and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our
            Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information
            through the internet without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
            child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us,
            and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. For residents of the
            European Union, where processing of personal information is based on consent, we will
            not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established
            by applicable data protection law.
          </p>
          <p>
            As children’s privacy is important to us at Quidd, we have incorporated special measures
            (described below) to help children protect their privacy while using the App:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There may be portions of the App \that children can participate in. To enable
              participation, the Personal Information we collect upon registration will either allow
              or deny users the ability to participate in features of the App.
            </li>
            <li>
              To participate in certain features of the App, we may ask a user to register. When
              users who attempt to register indicate that they are children, we restrict access to
              content and features that is appropriate for them. Generally, we either attempt to not
              collect personally identifiable information from them or direct them to the parent’s
              center in the App.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless we obtain consent, personally identifiable information collected from Children
              is generally used by Quidd or Quidd’s agents and contractors for internal purposes,
              such as providing customer services and/or for the purposes for which the information
              was provided. We do not share personally identifiable information with outside third
              parties not bound by this Policy for their own marketing purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may share children’s personally identifiable information with third parties to the
              extent reasonably necessary to (i) protect the security or integrity of our App; (ii)
              take precautions against liability, (iii) respond to judicial process or law
              enforcement agency request or investigation, (iv) or to the extent permitted by law or

              If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have
